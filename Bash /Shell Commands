Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.
The common redirection commands are:
> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.

A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:
sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
